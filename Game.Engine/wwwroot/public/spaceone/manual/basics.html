<p><strong>BASICS FOR PLAYING</strong></p>

<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>

<p>Space1.io is a real-time strategy shooter game that takes place on a planar arena. You get points by damaging and defeating other players' fleets (distinguished by colour and name). The leaderboard is available to show you the instantaneous scores of a subset of all players, along with player names.</p>

<p>Your fleet is a collection of ships ('doritos') that you have, and they congregate to the center of your viewport. You may not change the name or colour during the game.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>

<p>Start the game here (http://www.spaceone.io), pick a colour above the box by clicking on one of the colored "doritos". Insert an appropriate name in the central box and click start. The arena should appear. Your fleet is the one anchored to the center of the viewport.</p>

<p>Putting the graphics settings to "Low" may help with lag.</p>

<p>Don't go beyond the red border for a prolonged period of time. Ship count will be reduced.</p>

<p>If fleet's location reaches a half-screen distance from border beyond the red border then respawn is triggered.</p>

<p>Use mouse to navigate, ships will travel toward to the general direction of the mouse</p>

<p>Press 's' to split, with the speed boost directed toward instantaneous ship momentum direction.</p>

<p>Points are accumulated by damaging other fleets and eating leftovers from others' splitting. No points are awarded for shooting own leftover fleets and asteroids.</p>

<p>Bonus points are awarded for defeating players in arenas as per following:</p>

<pre><code>points=max{5,5*(min{12,numPlayer+1}-rank)}
</code></pre>

<p>where rank is the rank of the player defeated.</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong></p>

<p>Left-click or spacebar to shoot. Number of lasers equals number of ships at the moment of firing.</p>

<p>Larger fleet sizes result in larger laser cluster but slower laser-travel speed.</p>

<p>Avoid others' lasers! Lasers from other players reduce your ship count upon contact. If player ship count reaches 0, score is halved upon respawn.</p>

<p>Keep your mouse cursor close to the center. This generally provides better handling and control in terms of dodging.</p>

<p>Generally, shoot where you think the opponent will be instead of where they are now; lasers travel at finite speed.</p>

<p>Avoid positional and numerical inferiority by observing the environment around.</p>

<p>If you want to shoot at someone (offensive style), focus at the enemy ship you want to hit and predict where they might be, while paying attention to crossfire from other fleets. If you want to dodge and stay alive (defensive), take care to avoid bullets and shoot to repel opponents. Playing passive is safer in medium sized arenas but point accrual is lower.</p>

<p><strong>A Sampler of Invented Moves</strong></p>

<p>Not listed in any particular order.</p>

<p>Arkham's Sauron Doge - You dashes and shoot at the target while in dash. This immediately refills your ship count from the dashing and allows continued attack without losing momentum</p>

<p>Assassin's Ambush - Play as a "spacebar fleet"; approach and "munch" unsuspecting fleets of the same colour.</p>

<p>Munch Munch's Munch - With an overwhelming amount of ships, you dash at unsuspecting enemies to place yourself in close proximity and click! And they're gone!</p>

<p>Reality's Flick Shot - Moving toward a certain direction A, you shoot at another arbitrary direction B using a quick movement of the mouse from A to B, click, and move it back from B to A in one move. Very useful!</p>

<p>Swerve Squadron/Nestor's Nest - Build some nest out of excess ships! The ships can be creatively arranged for ornamental or protection purposes!</p>

<p><strong>A Primer to Team Formation</strong></p>

<p>Team with your friends! It is possible in Space1.io! Just remember that friendly fire will still harm your teammates and effective manoeuvre is necessary to succeed.</p>

<p>The usual spin-to-team gesture apply in this game, though keep in mind not all players are equally willing to team with you.</p>

<p>Notation as follows:
    X = allies, O = foes, -> = attack paths</p>

<p>The foci - Arrangement of two teammates characterized by a short horizontal distance between them. All part of the viewport is covered by either teammate and the teammate provides an useful pivot for cover without minimizing field of vision/attack paths. The basic bullet walls, laser volleys, and positional castling are all achievable in this rudimentary formation.</p>

<p>The four rooks - Arrangement of five teammates with the 'protected' player in the middle. The middle player can ideally fire through the gaps of the rooks and maintain attack prowess without sacrificing defensive advantage. A nice bonus is to be able to castle around multi-directionally too.</p>
