[Chapter Pollux]

> Pollux (Beta Geminorum) is the brightest star in the constellation Gemini. It is named after one of twin brothers from Greek and Roman mythology. The other twin, Castor also has a star named after him, but is less brighter than Pollux. However, the two stars are not twin-like at all. Pollux is a orange-colored star that is the closest giant star to the Sun; it is located approximately 34 light years away from here. It is the 17th brightest star in the night sky. Pollux can also be located by drawing a northwestern line that goes through Rigel and Betelgeuse

little dr.: *Skimming over some code that is displayed on a holographic screen.* Hm...this is taking me longer than I thought. I would have liked to send this killbot out on a test run today, but I guess that can wai-

Madara: *Hastily opens the door and dashes up to little dr.'s desk.* GUESS WHAT I FOUND?!?

little dr.: Whoa, whoa, relax...! What could you possibly have for you to be *this* energetic?

Madara: *Takes out a few containers containing individual, different colored, glowing fragments.* I found some of these things in the arena!

little dr.: Hmm? *Picks up a container with a small, white shard and examines it closely*

Madara: What are they?

little dr.: *Tilts the container to move the shard around.* Actually, I do-

GUCCI: *Rushes into dr.'s office.* Sorry to interrupt, but I just found a bunch of these weird shards floating in the arena. I saw someone shot at one and their fleet was suddenly able to shoot faster, despite their large fleet size. Care to explain?

little dr.: Well, as I was saying, I have no clue what they are.

GUCCI: Say what now?

little dr.: I've never seen them before...You also mentioned something about a pilot being able to fire lasers faster?

GUCCI: *Nods.* It's like as if these fragments give you power-ups or something.

little dr.: *Looks at Madara.* Have you seen any unusual effects caused by these fragments?

Madara: I saw Paki moving super fast and he kicked my butt a few times. :v

GUCCI: I don't want to even think about a faster Cyan…

little dr.: Okay, anything else you two observed? *Examines the container with an orange-colored shard.*

Madara: *Shakes head.* No.

GUCCI: Hmm, not that I've seen.

Boop: *Standing in the doorway.* How about a fleet shooting a destructive, long-distance laser?

Madara: Wut?

GUCCI: Wait...How destructive?

Boop: *Walks towards the group.* I was just minding my own business when suddenly I saw this streak of light coming from my right and watched it take down a few fleets all at once…

little dr.: *Looks at the different colored fragments* Seems like that each of these fragments provides a fleet with a unique ability.

GUCCI: If it's really not you who released them, then who did?

little dr.: I doubt the other bot builders are responsible and there hasn't been an update log about this, I believe. *Quickly checks the Captain's Log.* Yeah, no update on the Captain's Log.

Boop: *Glances at the containers and shards.* I see 7 different colors here...therefore pilots can acquire 7 different abilities. Anyways, I'm going to head back out and figure out what these shards do. Guess I'll attempt to have fun while avoiding getting killed *too often*.

Madara: Haha, race all of you to the arena! *Dashes out of the office immediately.*

GUCCI: *Sighs.* There he goes...Might as well join you, Boop. Plan to join us, dr.?

little dr.: I might as well experience it for myself. Let me quickly contact EU and NA West first and ask them if they are also seeing these new features. *Pulls up Discord.*

Boop: Got it, see ya later then. *Boop and GUCCI leave the office*

little dr.: *Quickly messages both servers, glances at the shards, and gets up to leave*

_In the EU Server, the pilots were also facing the same effects from the mysterious shards…_

Werewolf: So this light yellow shard gives you a temporary shield…? *Holds up a small fragment.*

1: Yeah, these new shards give us new powers.

Werewolf: What does this do? *Picks up a blue-white shard.*

1: I'd be careful with that if I were-

Werewolf: *Fires a powerful, single laser that immediately takes down a noob fleet that was shooting at him.* Oh-wasn't expecting that!

1: Ye, that shard packs a punch. xD You lose some of your ships though whenever you use it.

Werewolf: I see...Is this a new update?

dein Bruder: *Flies over to 1 and Werewolf.* No, it's not; and it seems like the NA server also has these fragments floating around.

1: Hm?

dein Bruder: *Shows the message from little dr.*

Werewolf: Who is responsible for them?

dein Bruder: *Shrugs.* Perhaps an unknown hacker? little dr. claims that it's not him. Besides, he's been building bots lately.

1: Might as well have fun with it while it lasts, you know?

Werewolf: I guess we should figure out what these shards do in the meanwhile?

dein Bruder: Sure, why not. Does anybody happen to know how many different fragments there are?

1: So far, there are 4 unique abilities we know of: increased flight speed, increased firing speed, provide a temporary shield, and that...deadly laser.

Werewolf: I've noticed that they're kind of rare at the moment. Perhaps there are more out there. :D

dein Bruder: I'm going to message little dr. back before I continue playing. *Leaves the two pilots behind.*

Werewolf: *Messenger beeps and checks it.* Oh, seems like Sasha has found a shard that gives pilots the ability to create a "death zone" around the player...Interesting.

1: Like the Death Zone that surrounds the arena?

Werewolf: *Nods* However, she's very confused about where these shards came from. It's like as if they suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

1: We'll eventually find out sooner or later…

_Back in little dr.'s office..._

little dr.: *Plops into his chair at his desk and pulls up Discord.* Hm…? dB messaged me...Probably answering that message I sent earlier. *Reads the response.* I see. So, those fragments are also in the EU arena as well. I bet that they are also in the West arena.

ThePilot: *Casually walks into little dr.'s office and notices the pile of shiny fragments on his desk* Looks like you already know about them, huh?

little dr.: I assume that you're here to discuss that?

ThePilot: *Nods.* I got that message from you earlier but decided to drop by here while I'm visiting the East section.

little dr.: Say...You're not the one responsible for these power-ups, are you?

ThePilot: Me? Nah. I thought it was you at first until you sent that message. I like these power-ups, though.

little dr.: I'm still curious about who implemented them...It'd be interesting if I could equip my bots with those fragments.

Strange: *Enters the office.* Thinking about that so soon? ;) *Walks up to the desk.*

little dr.: Hah! Why, of course!

Strange: I found that this particular fragment's ability is to give you any random ability. *Places a pale orange shard on dr.'s desk* It forces you to adapt to whatever power you get from it.

little dr.: Interesting. *Makes note of it on a notepad.*

ThePilot: I remember that some pilots lost fewer ships whenever they would split. I bet that's another ability.

Strange: I've noticed that too, especially when a larger fleet would split.

little dr.: That would benefit pilots that are dash-heavy. I could easily improve my bots with these mysterious shards if I wanted to.

Strange: Heh, I guess that future of you taking over Spaceone is getting closer. ;)

little dr.: Before I do that, I'm going to look into them first. I'll try to figure out where they exactly come from and see if they'll permanently stay in the game.

ThePilot: Roger that. I might as well do some digging myself. I'll see you all later. *Waves as he walks out.*

Strange: So, nobody claimed responsibility for them, huh?

little dr.: *Shakes head.* So far, nobody has reported anything suspicious relating to the fragments. I suppose that we might as well play along with it for now. Heh, this kind of reminds me when we suddenly saw those bots for the first time a few months ago…
