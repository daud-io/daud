[Chapter Sirius]

> Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris) is a well-known star; it is the brightest star in the sky and is twice as bright as the next brightest star, Canopus. It is also known as the Dog Star since it is the brightest star in its constellation, Canis Major. In Greek, Seirios means 'scorching' or 'glowing'. The star is actually a binary star system; one is a main-sequence star (Sirius A) and the other is a white dwarf (Sirius B). The only reason why it is so bright compared to other stars is that it is much closer to Earth, at a distance of 8.6 light years. The Sirius star system is approaching the Solar System slowly; so it will continue to get brighter. This star is seen in the northern latitude in the late fall and into early spring.

_The pilots of Spaceone showed up in their native servers, ready to fight the corporation and waiting patiently for the portal to open up to their first target…_

Arkham: Holy moly, this is the biggest invasion in Spaceone history and I'm a part of it! I feel all giddy inside! *His eyes sparkle with excitement and eagerness to dominate.*

Reality: Of course you are. *Looks at Ark, who has a ridiculous amount of shards in his ships' storage tank* But, this is going to be interesting.

Madara: Wait. Can we come back if we die?

little dr.: Technically, we're fighting them on a "server", as odd as that sounds; so yes.

Boop: But, if you die, you lose all of the shards collected up to that point. That means you would have to continue fighting without using any shards. Not saying we have to use them, but it'll probably take more time to defeat them.

little dr.: *Thinks for a moment.* Actually, you could collect more shards after you die. Just return to this server, collect some shards, and join back into the battle.

Strange: It's still a good idea to not die too often. I wouldn't spend too much time farming shards.

Swerve Squadron: *Building a nest out of his ships.* So, what are we waiting for?

Strange: We're actually a little early; just waiting for a message from Iris when they are ready…

_Meanwhile, several light years away at Pollux..._

Iris: Alright guys...You ready to end this 4-month spying mission?

Clyde: Been waiting for several months now to put these guys in jail. *Monitoring all changes done to the ship's computer systems.*

Zayden: I hope we get a raise or something after all of this. I could go for an upgrade for my gear at this point...And I need a faster charger. *Death glares at his outdated, slow equipment charger.*

Enzo: Considering that these guys are responsible for violating multiple laws, murdered an innocent person, and caused "unnecessary chaos", we probably will. Wait-we'll probably also have to appear in court after this.

Zebulon: Oh… (\ TmT(\ *Sighs with disappointment and sobs internally.* Can we not? I doubt it'll be a short trial…

Alice: *Shakes head.* It's something we can't avoid. Ah, the benefits of working secretly for a government but at the same time, not really...

Enzo: You think she's going to be okay with receiving that much power, Alice?

Alice: Hm? Answer this: How destructive can a magical girl be? ^u^) *Gives Enzo a smile you would probably be worried about.*

Zebulon: I can answer that: destructive enough to break the universe...Through hopes and dreams. Are you not aware how much damage one can do if their attacks involve manipulating time and space? *Throws a small dagger at a dartboard that barely misses the center. He frowns and he walks over to retrieve it.*

Alice: Nah, you just don't like cute and fluffy stuff. :3 She'll only have that power temporarily...It's better than him receiving it. Who knows what else he could have done, knowing he wants to take over the universe... Anyways, we're very lucky that the boss took the bait and she became the oracle instead.

Zebulon: *Mumbles to himself as he takes out the dagger.* If we all die because of a magical girl, it'll be all your fault…But yeah, still better than the boss getting it.

Iris: I'm sure she'll be able to handle it well. She'll be able to distract him while we attack the other fleets.

Zayden: Have you gotten confirmation from Cyan that she is at the location and ready?

Iris: Yeah. Anyways, I think it's time to get this show on the road~ Let us begin~

_A few minutes passed by before the pilots of Spaceone received a message from Iris:_

"_We're all inside the Fleet of Pollux and ready to proceed. Attack immediately as soon as you arrive!"_

_[Phase 1: Pollux]_

_Using dr.'s Ansible, all of the pilots and a massive horde of "friendly" bots were teleported over to the giant, yellow-orange colored star. They could see the five ships that make up the fleet in front of the star and a large planet in the distance. To have some form of protection, the bots were placed in front of the pilots._

Arkham: Daaaaaamn, those are some huge ships! They'll all be mine once we shut them down, hahaha!

YouWillLose: I **will** get them under my control first. Everyone knows that's going to happen.

Pakistani Bully: But, we all know Paki is too good! Therefore, we already won! :D

Madara: We haven't even started yet lol

joevicious: I'm not letting any of these nofrez try to dominate us; they'll have to go through us first before their desires come true.

Strange: We got this; show them absolutely no mercy!

Werewolf: Let's make them regret that they ever dared to mess with us...I'll make them surrender to Werestalin. :D

\F/A\B/: Unless they all run away from me first. *Playfully punches Werewolf's shoulder.* I hope they are well prepared and put up a memorable fight.

ThePilot: They'll also have to deal with some "friendly" bots as well. Hopefully, they'll be able to overwhelm them and don't destroy them all instantly or something.

little dr.: Eh, the bots aren't that bad...Think of them as a nice housewarming gift that keeps on giving. Like I've said before, "my killbots aren't evil, just misunderstood".

Strange: Says the evil genius. ;)

Munch Munch: At least we have two evil people that are on our side.

little dr.: Heh...For now. I'll save the destructive stuff for another day. ;)

ThePilot: But now, we shall fight against greater evil together.

Reality: It's about time we all introduce ourselves to our "new" neighbors...

Arkham: Heh heh, of course! The time has come to dominate these puny peasants and make them kneel before us and more importantly, me!

_The attack started off with the massive, seemingly endless river of bots were at the front. The bots split off into five groups and all started attacking the five space vessels. Inside the ships, everyone onboard started to panic from the sudden attacks; their ships' radar hasn't detected any enemy fleets approaching them and didn't give them any warning beforehand. Then, both Reality and Ark lead the initial pilot attack against the first group of enemy ships._

Reality: Activate amplified lasers now!

_Primary long-range snipers all stood close together and activated a portion of their Sirius shards. They aimed at specific locations that they were assigned on a minor ship, making sure to avoid the area where shards were being produced. After a brief moment of their ships' lasers powering up, they fired multiple, bright lasers towards the enemy fleets. These merciless beams of light were powerful enough to pierce through the other side of the vessels._

Munch Munch: Yes, bull's eye!

DarthFriends: Woah, that was so powerful...Enough to literally go all the way through a massive spaceship.

Boop: Sheesh. That's some serious damage right there. And I thought that single laser I almost got hit by back then was powerful…

Strange: Definitely. These fragments have gotten a lot stronger since the summoning is almost complete.

Arkham: Hoho, indeed...And we're going to use that to our advantage. Time to do some hurting up close and personal!

_The next phase of assault involves the use of multiple shards from Aldebaran (decreases ships lost via splitting), Procyon (Increased flight speed), and Capella (temporary shield). The pilots involved in this assault came together, activated their shards, and gained the abilities needed. Once they obtained their abilities, the pilots quickly teleported behind the ships using Ansible to avoid the crossfire from the bots attacking at the front. At this point, the enemies knew where their attackers were. However, when they attempted to shoot at the pilots, they couldn't inflict any damage on them. The pilots started to fire back at the guns with their regular lasers._

Werewolf: We are moving super fast-They can't even keep up with us!

Kuw: Just make sure you keep your ships under control and don't run into their lasers.

1: Ye, we should be able to distract these guys just enough for the others to attack from the sides and catch them off guard. *Dodges multiple lasers and destroys a gun.* Their weapons are more well-armored than they look…

_At that point, they could hear multiple explosions coming off from the side. A few minutes later, it seemed like the number of lasers attacking the pilots have lessened._

Imperial Fleet: *Flies over to the group attacking the ship's weapons.* Took care of all of the guns that were shooting at you all from the sides. Apparently, utilizing the mini Death Zone Field can destroy them much quicker than just shooting at them.

Hedwig: Let's just finish off the ones here and that should be it for this spaceship until it's shield activates.

Sasha: Be careful, however. I feel like some of our lasers are randomly reflected.

joevicious: I wonder if that virus Clyde made is responsible for that...We'll just have to use the Death Zone Field to take out the rest.

42: We've only got 3 more ships to disable; the first ship we attacked activated its shield.

DreamWeaver: Yes, let's keep on going!

Strange: We've been doing well so far. Let's hope things continue to go smoothly until we bring this fleet down.

_The passengers and crew onboard the ships were frantically trying to keep their ship from being destroyed by the pilots. However, when some of the members tried to get into the main control room, they found their system operators lying on the floor outside the locked door, unconscious._

"_Were those pilots responsible for all of this?!"_

"_And, where are our officers? Aren't they onboard as well?"_

"_Yeah. I'm assuming they're not the ones inside the control room. If they were, then they would have put the ships in full defense mode already."_

"_...! Wait-does that mean they were ambushed as well?! And some of those pilots managed to get inside without being detected?!"_

"_I'll send out an SOS signal to Sirius right away! If we don't act soon, we'll all die here…! Boss isn't going to like it when he hears his officers were killed too"_

_However, Cyan was "patiently" waiting for that SOS message to arrive at her location…_

Cyan: Aggggh! How much longer will I have to wait…?! (\ èoé)/ Watching others destroy their toy ships is fun, but it's not as fun as being the one destroying them.

_A pinging sound started to go off; she had received a message that was from the fleet at Pollux._

Cyan: FINALLY! *Throws confetti.* Now, let's see what it says~ *Opens up the message that was supposed to go to the Sirius fleet.*

_The message read:_

"_This is an SOS message from Pollux! We are being attacked by aggressive pilots and bots; two ships are already on lock-down status and unable to function. Backup is requested from all other fleets immediately!"_

Cyan: Okay, just going to change it to make it seem like everything is a-okay! :3 *Edits the message to make it seem like everything is normal at Pollux.* Annnnnnd done. *Sends it to the original recipient.* Now, I wait some more for updates. Fun…

_A few minutes later, the space elf intercepted a message from Sirius. The message revealed that the crew of the Sirius fleet had not realized that one of their partner fleets were being taken over. Cyan sighed in relief and continued to watch her fellow pilots dominate the Pollux fleet. It didn't take too long for the pilots to disable all ships without too much difficulty and the rebel officers to take control. The first phase was a success._

dein Bruder: Our first battle was a success; a job well done everyone! :)

Arkham: Pfffft, that was so easy! They all went down in less than an hour!

Munch Munch: I guess this is was Zayden meant when he said that they underestimated us.

Sasha: It was still a little tiring to dodge all of the lasers, though…

1: Agreed. There was more crossfire than what I have experienced in the arenas.

Imperial Fleet: I'm sure it'll get more difficult as we fight the other fleets. Don't think that it'll be this easy to take down the rest.

Strange: True. Even if Cyan alters the original SOS message, they'll realize that something is wrong sooner or later. Those bots did really help us out; they really did a number on those ships.

little dr.: Until then, we'll just continue taking over as much as we can. The main goal is to fight the Sirius fleet with the other six fleets crippled beyond use. It'll make it less complicated for us when the final showdown happens.

_dr. received a message from one of the officers of_ _Astral Passageways_ _on his scroll:_

"Great job everyone! With both of our combined efforts, I can confirm that Fleet Pollux is now fully under our control. This was a successful attack, but we still have six more to go. Keep it up; we will let you know when we are ready for our next attack on Aldebaran. Until then, take a rest and come by here to stock up on more shards. See you all at the next battle!

- Officer Halley of Pollux"

ThePilot: Wasn't she the officer who wasn't there at the meeting?

little dr.: That's right. I recall Zebulon saying that she was busy scouting or something like that at the time.

Reality: I'm really curious how they all managed to take control of the ships from the inside. There must be a huge number of crew members who operate them.

Strange: I highly doubt they're ordinary people. Enzo said something about bounty hunting before and they also arrest criminals…

little dr.: A mysterious bunch, indeed. They may have other motives, besides just helping us and taking down the organization.

dein Bruder: For now, it's probably best for us to be on their good side. Until they drop any hints that they have other plans for us.

little dr.: I still wonder how Enzo created this nifty thing… *Holds up the Electronic Clandestine Scroll* This far exceeds the current tech we have.

Arkham: What if…*Gasps dramatically.* They are time travelers?!?!

Boop: Time traveling bounty hunters? A likely story.

_The pilots and the rebel officers continued on to_ _[Phase 2: Aldebaran]_ _and_ _[Phase 3: Procyon]__. Both missions were successful, but the pilots noticed an increase of difficulty as they attacked more fleets. This also applied to the officers who were betraying their co-workers…_

[Phase 4: Rigel]

_The seven officers of the Heavenly G were aboard the main ship of the fleet stationed at the blue-white supergiant star, Rigel. They were having a small chat in a private meeting room before initiating their next assault._

Iris: Whew, I can't believe we're going to destroy our fourth fleet already. How do you all feel about our progress?

Zebulon: It's been going well so far. I admire how much ambition the pilots of Spaceone have.

Alice: I agree and they seem very welcoming too. Anyways, did anyone else notice that the rest of the remaining members of the organization still haven't noticed that three of their fleets are occupied by us?

Enzo: I'm sure they already have some suspicions about the pilots being too quiet about the rising tensions between the organization and them. They aren't going to say anything about it until we get caught or confronted by them. They've been increasing the security around the remaining fleets lately. *Sips his coffee.*

Halley: I have a feeling something interesting may happen... The stars will continue to shine in our favor towards a brighter tomorrow for those innocent. But, we must be on the lookout of a star of the sixth that may suddenly grow brighter and blind us from reality. That's the divine message from Lady Asteria for today~

Iris: Hm. Maybe someone on our side will backstab us? That's how I interpret it and I hope that isn't the case.

Zebulon: There are several different outcomes are possible, based on her message. We'll have to decipher what it means before it's too late.

Iris: We don't have any more time to lose; we can't keep them waiting any longer. I just hope that this forecasted message will not happen during this battle. Let's get going! *Sends out a message to the pilots allowing them to teleport to Rigel and get ready for their next intense battle.*

_The pilots received the message from Iris and immediately headed over to Rigel. The star was particularly bright and as expected, the fleet was made up of five space vessels._

Reality: Keep in mind that Enzo said that this fleet contains the majority of their tech squad and may already be on to us. So, we're basically up against multiple evil tech guys this time.

Strange: A war of bots against bots? Sounds like fun to me. ;)

little dr.: Enzo and Clyde warned us to not hold back on the aggressiveness of our bots for this battle. I took their word for it after they explained what their tech sector does and told us what they were planning to do to defend themselves. Luckily, our bots are programmed not to fire any lasers at pilots. I'm also sending out those "i love you" bots too.

ThePilot: Well, we're still going to have to destroy the five ships ourselves...Our bots will serve as a distraction for most of their bots.

Munch Munch: "Most of their bots"...?

ThePilot: While the majority will be facing our bots, there will be some that serve as "guards" to prevent us from inflicting direct damage with the ships. By some...I mean bots that completely surround the ships.

MunchMunch: Considering how large their space vessels are, it's going to take a long time to shut down a single one. :/

Arkham: We'll be fine, as long as we don't run out of the fragments from Sirius. *Has a bunch of Sirius shards in his arms.* The plan this time is for everyone to fire their amplified laser all at once at the bots surrounding their ships. Easy peasy!

Reality: While these bots won't take any damage from attacks enhanced by the shards, they will temporarily be disabled due to the overwhelming energy received. We can then use that chance to use our regular lasers to destroy their guard bots. But, we will most likely be faced with lasers coming from the enemy ship, so watch out for those too.

Swerve Squadron: So, we should probably focus on destroying the bots first before they reactivate. One suggestion I have is to sacrifice some of your ships via dashing to create some sort of absorption/safety barrier. From previous encounters, the lasers coming from their ships act the same as our lasers. Our dead ships can be used to block some of their attacks.

Arkham: Yes yes, that sounds like a mighty fine idea, coming from the nest builder himself! *Eyes sparkle with excitement.*

Imperial Fleet: Do you know how long it will take for their bots to reactivate?

little dr.: It can take about 3 minutes for them to be back online. There's no way we'll be able to destroy all of them at once, so we'll need to repeat the whole process multiple times. We'll need to be super careful; our enemies will obviously pick up what we're doing and adjust how they are defending themselves.

dein Bruder: This time, two battles will be happening at the same time. We'll need to pay extra close attention to what is going on around us. Though, I think it will become a little easier as time goes on. The officers will take control from within and disable their bots.

Reality: Has anybody wondered what they actually do to shut down their own fleet? I mean there are seven officers, but five huge ships. If all of them were to disable a ship one by one, wouldn't the other ships notice?

little dr.: They didn't tell us what they do exactly, but Enzo did drop a hint that they disperse specific roles and constantly communicate in order to shut them down all at once.

joevicious: They must be really good with teamwork and trust each other so much in order to pull off what they're doing.

Strange: Agreed and that is exactly what we'll be doing to win. After this, we have 2 more battles to fight before the last one.

Arkham: Heheheh...Prepare to fall to me, Fleet of Rigel!!

_little dr. sent a message to the officers, confirming they were ready to attack the fleet._

Iris: Alright guys, you know the drill. But this time, we'll need to work much faster, as these guys can pull off an unexpected attack on the pilots at any second.

Clyde: This is going to be a fun battle. I bet they'll love seeing their own systems shutting down before they realize what's happening and won't be able to recover it.

Iris: Good luck and be vigilant, everyone...

_Enzo, Alice, and Clyde remained on the ship they were currently on while the rest of the group teleported to the other ships._

Enzo: Well, let's say "good morning" to our fellow workers, yes? *Takes out his scroll and powers it on.*

Clyde: Assuming they're even fully awake now. If not, we'll give them a "nice wake-up" call.

Alice: Sheesh, you two… Let's just start by heading up to the control room.

Enzo: Fine. I'm hoping we can just get in and they don't know about our true intentions.

Alice: Oh, don't worry~ Let me handle them this time. *Smiles innocently at Enzo.*

Clyde: If a Lunarian ever gives you a smile like that, s/he most likely has something ill-fated planned for the unfortunate victim(s)...Show them what you got, Alice.

_The three of them got on the elevator and arrived at the top floor, where the ship's main computers and control system were. As usual, there were plenty of guards on patrol, scouting for anyone suspicious. Since the three officers had the top positions, the guards allowed them to go through without any resistance. They casually made their way to the control room, where they were greeted by the ship's operators._

Alice: Good morning to all of you~ My my, all of you are up so early.

Rigel Operator 1: Of course, Officer Alice.

Rigel Operator 2: So, what brings the three of you here?

Enzo: Just wanted to check in with the fleets personally and maybe do some maintenance on the system. Always a good idea to protect your computer from viruses and evil malware. Isn't that riiiight, Clyde? ;) *Smirks before playfully elbowing the other tech officer.*

Clyde: *Gives a look of disapproval towards Enzo.* Heh...Sure. Actually, we're also here to show our appreciation for your hard work. Why not relax for today and let us take the reins? The officers are on the other ships as well, offering your fellow operators the same deal.

Rigel Operator 3: *Looks away from his screen and turns to the officers.* Huh? No way...A day off?

Alice: Hehe, of course~ We wouldn't have progressed so far without all of you working so hard. Enzo and Clyde will be the ship's operators for today and I'll treat you all with a nice breakfast.

Rigel Operator 1: Frick yeah, I'm in! *Immediately throws off his headset and rushes out of the room.*

Rigel Operator 4: Was this something you guys thought of doing or…?

Clyde: Oh please. You really think the boss would do something for you guys? Of course, we thought about giving you guys a small break.

Enzo: We've already done the same for the other three fleets below your rank.

Rigel Operator 3: That reminds me, we received a distress signal from Fleet Aldebaran the other day.

Alice: Hmm? A...distress signal?

Rigel Operator 3: Yeah, they said they were under attack or something.

Alice: Oh, we were there when that happened. Don't worry, we took care of the attackers. We took them down easily. ;)

Rigel Operator 2: *Sighs in relief.* That's good to hear.

Enzo: *Pats Rigel Operator 2 on the back.* No need to worry. If we get attacked today, we got this.

Alice: Anyways, you all have permission to leave the control room. I'll join you all shortly; I need to have a quick word with these two gentlemen here.

_The three officers watched the operators leave the room. Once the doors closed, the three faced each other and started talking to each other via scroll._

Enzo: "Dear Alice, why won't you treat me to a nice breakfast someday? It's been a while since you cooked me anything. ;)"

Alice: "...Oh, you. ;)" *Playfully punches Enzo's left arm.*

Clyde: "Haha, lovebirds...How long do you think it'll take, Alice?"

Alice: "Give me only 3 minutes. That's all I need; I'll be back here before the white rabbit runs by."

Enzo: "Once you return, we'll proceed as usual. I'm curious about what you are going to do this time."

Alice: "Hehe, I'll tell you later. Have fun playing with the ship's computers~ \&lt;3"

_Alice leaves the two tech officers behind and they both sit down at the largest computer/control panel._

Enzo: So, just the usual shenanigans? *Leans back in his chair.*

Clyde: Mhm. *Holds up what looks similar to an old floppy disk.* Gotta spread the fun stuff around to other ships first.

Enzo: Is that...A floppy disk? Classy.

Clyde: Heh, gotta love first generation tech...The really old stuff. This is actually a hard-case folder that resembles one. *Opens it up and a tiny piece of hardware that resembles a memory

card was inside. He takes it out of the folder and casually inserts it into a tiny slot located to his right.*

Enzo: You and your ancient gadgets...I remember you showed me some kind of taser that resembled a USB drive…And I found out the hard way.

Clyde: Hey, at least you didn't die. It was only a tiny shock. *Waits for a file menu to pop up on the holographic screen before proceeding to select a few options.* Oh boy...Seems like they already have suspicions.

Enzo: Heh, you know what to do.

Clyde: Yeah, yeah. Second-hand security measures got nothing on me. *Opens up the system's main file menu and searches through them.* I bet even you can tear this down yourself easily.

Enzo: I mean, I always had to disable that stuff when I was scambaiting regularly a few years ago. Fun times...

Clyde: You were a scambaiter? Nice. At least I didn't get involved with the scamming business. It's not as fulfilling as hacking government files or developing cool weapons of mass destruction. *Continues to work on disabling the security measures set on the ship's computer and finishes without breaking a sweat.* That was easy...A little too easy. I bet they're hiding something else in there; I'll just need to search around more.

_At that moment, Alice came strolling into the room and locked the door behind her before walking over to Enzo and Clyde._

Enzo: *Turns around to see his wife.* Alice, that wasn't even three minutes. Just what did you do?

Alice: *Shrugs.* They just fell asleep quickly as soon as they drank their coffee.

Enzo: You put some of _that_ in their coffee, didn't you? *Gives her a blank stare.*

Alice: Mhm. *Gives Enzo a cheeky smile as she showed him a tiny vial filled with an odd-colored liquid that had a tag labeled "Drink Me".*

Enzo: ...And that is why you should never consume anything that has "Drink Me" or "Eat Me" on it. Anyways, I'm just watching Clyde demolishing their poorly constructed security walls.

Clyde: *Sighs in disappointment before leaning back in his seat, looking at the screen.* Well, that was unfortunately unsatisfying. Even as an admin, I couldn't find anything else. There was nothing different from the previous fleets, besides the extra security installments.

Enzo: Well then...Guess they're not as clever as we initially thought. We should sail easily now, right? *Leans back in his chair.*

Clyde: Ready to wreak havoc once again. *Proceeds to open up the file containing the destructive virus on the ship's computer*

_At that moment, they could hear multiple explosions from outside. The epic battle between the pilots and the Rigel fleet had begun. However, the three officers heard the back door open behind them and they all turned around to see three guards standing in the doorway, all pointing their laser rifles straight at them._

Guard 1: You really thought we were that clueless? Think again. *Shoots his laser rifle at Clyde.*

Clyde: *Immediately takes out his tablet and swings it to reflect the shot away from the group.* Hmph. What are you going to do now? It's already too late, the virus has already begun to spread.

Guard 2: Surrender immediately, unfaithful officers.

Enzo: And what if we don't? *Gets up from his chair and grips his scroll.*

Guard 3: Then, we'll just have to force you to. We can make this simple or difficult. Up to you.

Alice: Oh my. What should we do…?

_As the tech trio slowly stepped backward toward the windshield of the ship and the guards approached them, Alice was slowly putting her right hand behind her as she was carefully observing the guards' actions._

Guard 1: What will it be, Asterian Officers? We don't have all day.

_The cornered officers looked at each other, seeming to not have any options to get out of their own grave._

Guard 3: It's not like you guys are capable of overwhelming professionally trained guards; you might as well give up.

Alice: *Raises one of her eyebrows.* Is that so? ...Think fast!

_In a blink of an eye, the engineer took out an opened box of playing cards from her back pocket and swung it towards the guards. The cards scattered everywhere; a dense curtain of descending cards was enough to block the guards' view of the officers for just a moment. Enzo swung one side of his scroll that wrapped around Guard 1's body tightly, causing the guard to drop his weapon. Clyde tackled Guard 2 down, pinning him aggressively to the floor. Alice quickly ran through the curtain of cards and managed to knock the gun out Guards 3's hands while he was distracted by delivering a forceful kick to his right arm._

Alice: *Immediately picks up the gun and points it at him.* What did you say before about us? Your role is over.

Guard 3: *Winces in pain as he slowly puts his hands in the air.* Just who are you guys...If you're not really working for us?

Alice: *Still has the gun pointed at the guard.* You'll probably find out soon enough. I'm just going to let you know that you all are under arrest and you will be seeing us in court. Just be glad that we're not going to kill you right here.

Enzo: Now then, hopefully, you'll be willing to work with us. I don't know about you, but programmers like us to keep it simple. You can make this simple or difficult for yourself. Up to you…

_Meanwhile, the pilots were outside the ships, fighting off the guard bots that were surrounding them. No matter how many they destroyed, it seemed like their numbers hadn't decreased at all._

Munch Munch: Anyone getting the feeling that they're constantly replacing their guard bots?

YouWillLose: I've killed over 100 bots, but they're all still coming back for us! So annoying!

Arkham: My patience with these bots wears thin... *Furiously glares at his emotionless enemies.*

Madara: I'm starting to feel tired and my hands are sweaty lol.

little dr: Either they auto-respawn once they die or there is another bot that's spawning in new bots to replace the ones that get destroyed.

Reality: If the latter is the case, then we should pay real close attention to where a new bot spawns. If not, then we'll just need to wait until the virus takes over the ship, right?

little dr.: *Nods.* At least we're still putting pressure on them by attacking them from the outside. While it may not seem like it, we have inflicted some damage on the ships themselves.

dein Bruder: We could damage their ship more if we all shoot our amplified lasers in an area, destroy the stunned bots, and then quickly inflict as much damage as we can within the vacant spot before new bots fill it.

Imperial Fleet: We could also pay attention to where the new bots are coming from that fill the gap. Once we have a general idea of where they may have originated from, we can repeat the process again and hope that the spawn bot is one of them that gets destroyed.

Strange: Sounds better than what we're doing right now.

Hedwig: I'm on board with that. We'll eventually become too tired, die more often, and make less progress.

joevicious: We can't just lose to a bunch of bots without fighting the real enemies. Besides, we all know that doc's and Pilot's bots are the real evil bots here.

little dr.: Heh, from what I've observed, our bots seem to be faring better than the organization's bots. ;) *Glances over to his left and sees a bunch of the enemy's bots, decimated.*

Strange: Tinkering with your bots for a couple of months before really paid off, huh?

DarthFriends: And we had multiple opportunities to fight them beforehand, so fighting off these bots aren't as bad.

Arkham: Heh heh, once we take these bots down, they'll stand no chance against us!

_The pilots went forward with their alternative plan of taking down the guard bots and paid close attention to anything that could indicate a spawn bot was present among the sea of guard bots surrounding the space vessel. A few minutes passed before the pilots finally tracked down a potential location of where the bots were spawning._

Acro: I hope this works…It'd be nice if we could finally destroy their shield of mindless bots.

Strange: Yeah, considering we're still on our first ship. *Starts activating a few of her Sirius shards.*

Reality: Everyone fire their amplified lasers in 3...2...1!

_In unison, the pilots shot their lasers boosted by the Sirius shard towards a wide area where they believed the bots were spawning. All of the bots hit by the blinding, energetic lasers stunned them, which the pilots took advantage of to destroy them all without having to dodge as much, using their regular lasers. They continued to repeat this process until they were able to completely take down the ship's guard bots._

Madara: That took forever! :v All of that to just take down their shield.

1: Let's quickly shut down this ship and the rest before they throw up more defenses against us.

ThePilot: Roger that! This is our chance to finish these guys off once and for all.

MunchMunch: Yes, time for a quik turnaround!

Moth: No mercy!!! Kill them all! *Starts viciously attacking the space vessel with her ship's lasers.*

_Once the ship's guard bots had all been destroyed by a torrent of colorful lasers coming from all sides, the pilots finally defeated their first ship of Rigel. Some were wary that their enemies would suddenly throw a curveball at them by changing how they were defending themselves, but nothing extraordinary happened, except for the occasional activation of their automatic shield that would then disappear immediately. It almost seemed like they all went silent after some time. The ambitious pilots continued to utilize their effective tactic to destroy the remaining ships without much resistance and once again, came out victorious._

Arkham: *Throws his hands up in the air.* FINALLY! We came out victorious once again! Thanks to me, of course.

Strange: Phew, that sure lasted a long time...But we managed to shut them all down.

little dr.: This was a messy fight. *Looks out at a massive debris field filled with damaged bots as he recalls his own bots.* I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if the remaining battles are similar in nature.

ThePilot: ...Which means we'll likely encounter more of their bots. I bet the remaining tech guys will do everything they can to turn them into merciless killing machines to get rid of us once they learn what we've been doing to them.

Reality: With less of them available, they'll make less progress of making an even deadly version of their current bot. If we attack sooner, then it'll give them less time to make improvements.

little dr.: Knowing the two tech officers, they'll probably hinder the process greatly. *His scroll beeps and he takes it out to see a message from Enzo.*

"Good job everyone for taking down the Rigel fleet. We're now down to three fleets left and we have 4 days left until the Spring Equinox. With only a few days remaining until the Spring Equinox, everyone here is desperate to make the summoning a success, but haven't realized that more than half of their workforce is missing. They'll probably notice what's been going on very soon...Or they already have but aren't saying anything about it. I know you all are tired and we are too. The end of the war between us and them is near. You all have been awesome with your merciless laser barrage and doing all sorts of crazy maneuvers with your fleets...It intrigues me how you guys pull it off. Keep it up!

Officer Enzo of Rigel"

dein Bruder: We got this, guys! Just a little more and then this will all be over.

Reality: I do have to admit that this has been an interesting fight, something unique to add on to the history of the game...Well, as long as we live to tell it.

_After claiming victory at Rigel, the pilots returned back to their home servers to rest. The next two battles took place at Betelgeuse and Capella, with each battle becoming much more difficult, long lasting, and they died more often. But, the brave pilots refused to back down and surrender; they overcame everything thrown at them: curtains of lasers, bloodthirsty bots that targeted specific pilots randomly, and unique attack patterns that required mircododging. With an undying ambition, they continued to fight strongly against their enemy...While not realizing that two of their members mysteriously disappeared a day before the final showdown..._

[Phase 7: Sirius]

_The final fleet remained, located at the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius. With the deadline only a day away, everyone was desperate to accomplish their goals, including the aggressive and impatient mastermind of Astral Passageways. He knew that the pilots were going to attack the last fleet very soon. He stared out the large window, pondering what action he was going to take to achieve victory, despite his current circumstances. An assassin recently hired by him, known as the 'Night Watcher', silently approached him from behind, stopping a few steps away from him. The mastermind's eyes shifted to his right and saw the woman's reflection on the glass._

Night Watcher: Sir, the pilots are on their way right now.

Astral Mastermind: Heh, they're really eager to finish us off…Go out there and cause as much havoc and chaos to those pilots for as long as you can. Once all ships are disabled, come back here immediately. I will give you more orders then.

Night Watcher: Understood. I'll delay them for as long as I can.

Astral Mastermind: You better live up to your name...

Night Watcher: I'll send them into the heart of the Milky Way... If you'll excuse me, I must warm up before I destroy them, one by one.

She bowed before taking her leave and her boss grinned to himself. 'I'll show them who is their true leader...Just wait and see what I'm capable of with the power of the stars, pilots of spaceone...!'

_On her way to where her ship was located, the assassin wondered who her boss really was and if she'll find out today..._

_Meanwhile, all of the pilots were positioned at Sirius B, the white dwarf star that orbits Sirius A. They were ready to attack the last fleet of the organization. However, everyone received a message that read:_

"You really think you can take us down? I'd think about who you're really fighting against…"

Munch Munch: "think about who you're fighting against"...? I got a bad feeling about this…

little dr.: This is the final battle after all. I wonder what they'll throw at us...

Reality: Oh, I can't wait for the wonderful plot twists. Let's just get this over with and kick them out of here.

joevicious: Bring it on!! We're not letting them do whatever they please-

_Suddenly, a barrage of invisible lasers aimed directly at joevicious came from random directions. The pilot realized he was being attacked by noticing that some of his ships were starting to disappear, but he didn't see any lasers. He and some of the pilots attempted to shoot down the aggressor off-screen, but they realized that the attacker was under an invisible disguise._

little dr.: ! They know about the invisibility hack...?!

Strange: So that's what they meant in their message. Looks like someone from our side is fighting against us. But who?

YouWillLose: How can we fight against an invisible cheater?! I don't approve!

Reality: Where's Arkham? He's pretty late...

DarthFriends: I haven't seen Cyan around either. Maybe she was assigned to do something else for this battle?

Munch Munch: What if something happened to both of them?

dein Brother: …! Don't say that they…

Munch Munch: It's possible, considering that this is their last stand against us.

The Pilot: I'll contact the officers to confirm this. *Starts up the scroll to write a message but saw a message from the officers on the screen.* ...Huh?

little dr.: What's wrong? *Peeks at the holographic screen.*

The Pilot: This isn't good...They betrayed us-right at the end.

little dr.: *Skims through the message.* Heh. They're really going to throw everything they got at us. We're now fighting against the officers, who are now controlling the ships. They said that Ark and Cyan are with them...

Strange: Hopefully, they're both alright; we can't have the same terrible thing happen again.

DarthFriends: What's the plan this time? Won't we have to physically go inside the ship to rescue them and confront those responsible for all of this?

dein Bruder: But then we'll be putting ourselves in danger. We have no idea how their ships are structured and they may even be waiting for us to go inside.

joevicious: How cowardly...Using pilots as bait!

little dr.: We might have a chance here. I could attempt to override their computer systems-

Reality: How? Especially since we've got an experienced hacker capable of shutting down a government against us-

little dr.: *Grins.* Clyde gave me the most up-to-date version of his virus before today. ;) *Holds up a floppy disk.*

Munch Munch: A floppy disk…?

little dr.: *Opens the hard case folder resembling a floppy disk and inside was something that looked like a tiny sd card.* This contains the virus he used to shut down all of the computer systems.

Munch Munch: I wonder if he gave it to you on purpose? As if he predicted this would happen?

little dr.: Who knows? I'm going to utilize it; I can send it over to their ships, using the scroll. I can't guarantee this will work, but it's worth a shot.

_At that moment, little dr. saw more than half of his ships disappear in front of him without seeing anything physically hitting them._

little dr.: Shoot, the invisible person is trying to kill me off-he's been listening in on us.

Reality: Some pilots guard doctor and Pilot while they work on transferring the virus and the rest should start attacking the enemy fleets.

little dr.: Pay attention to where the invisible lasers hit you and the location of where your lasers hit their ships; it'll give you an idea of where the concealed assassin might be. You'll know you killed him because you'll see his name in the kill message.

1: I'm sure once we pinpoint where he might be, we might be able to overwhelm him. Perhaps even kill him by trapping him in with our lasers.

The Pilot.: We won't lose the harmful program if we end up dying, but it'll take us longer to send out the virus to their ships.

Hedwig: We can't afford to lose any more precious time, considering they have hostages.

Moth: We need to take them down as quickly as possible!

_The pilots who were best with teaming and defense protected the tech duo while aggressive pilots proceeded to attack the last five ships of Astral Passageways. The offensive team of pilots instantly noticed that there was a major jump in difficulty compared to the previously fought fleets. The five ships utilized amplified abilities of specific shards and complex attack patterns. However, the most persistent problem was the invisible attacker and the constant barrage of lasers coming from the assassin…_

Munch Munch: Whoever this person is, he's persistent at staying alive. He also seems to occasionally pick random opponents to shoot at.

Acro: He hasn't even died once yet, but we've died a few times. No one got the kill message with his name along with it yet?

DarthFriends: I don't think so. Sometimes, it even seems like he disappears occasionally, but then starts shooting again-

_joevicicous got a kill message on his dashboard. It read, "You killed #00FFFF!"_

joevicious: I killed him! ...I don't know who he is though-anybody recognize who #00FFFF is?

Munch Munch: Wait, that's hex code for cyan….Cyan?

Reality: Cyan's been with those guys all along? Why am I not surprised?

Strange: Wait, I don't think she would backstab us like that. She did become unresponsive for at least a day before we started this battle. Maybe she was kidnapped and forced to fight us?

Reality: Then, what about Ark? He didn't show up either.

Strange: Maybe he got captured too? We'll probably find out once we take care of these guys first.

little dr.: If that really was Cyan attacking us, then she'll come back very shorty-

_Suddenly, all of joevicious's ships disappeared from being hit by an invisible wall of lasers._

DarthFriends: *Gasps dramatically.* Noooo she got joe!!!

Reality: That's instant karma right there.

The Pilot: Wow, that didn't take her even a minute to get back here. She must have teleported here somehow.

MunchMunch: Maybe she's utilizing some of those shards. Or just pulling off a Tenshi.

little dr.: Please don't remind me. *Grimaces.* Well, I'm just about done working with this thing; I just need a few more minutes.

joevicious: *Returns back to the group.* That was very sudden. Cyan, if that's really you, I'm going to get you again!

_Despite continuously being attacked with invisible lasers, the virus was completed setting up and was sent directly into the enemy ship's systems. The virus spread to all of the ships like wildfire, forcefully shutting down the computer systems and rendering the enemy defenseless. The pilots mercilessly went on to inflict physical damage to the space vessels. The crew inside the ships were panicking, desperately trying to reboot the systems to at least summon the reflective shield._

_Clyde was watching the space vessel's internal systems fizzle out of commission as technicians tried to stop the destruction. One of the operators turned to the hacker with a helpless expression. The officer only shook his head._

Clyde: There's nothing I can do to stop it, not this particular virus. Whatever it gets into, it'll certainly die.

Technician: Not even you can stop it…?

Clyde: Just look at what's going on; it's already unrepairable. If you really think we can get out of this mess, please do tell.

_The room went silent as Clyde waited for an answer._

Clyde: That's what I thought. *His tablet beeps and he turns it on to check the notification.* Oh great, there's a group of people who broke into the main ship's bottom deck. They're probably headed straight for the big guy himself.

Technician 2: No way...We're really going to lose against these guys?

Clyde: *Turns around and heads toward the exit.* You guys are fated to lose against us. *Presses a button on the side of the door to open it.* My last, personal advice to you: find a legit job that won't land you in jail. *Runs out the room to head towards the invading group.*

_A few minutes later, the hacker joins up with the "invading group", the group of rebelling officers that are now headed to fight those in their way to confront their employer. They stopped in their tracks as soon as they saw many guards blocking the path with their guns pointed straight at them._

Zayden: Any idea how we're going to get through these guys?

Iris: There's only one way to handle this… *Stares at the guards.* Let us through, please.

Guard 1: Why should we? You can't make us, traitors!

Clyde: *Glances over at Halley.* This is why I haven't fed you anything yet. *Points at the guards.* They are your dinner.

Halley: Finally! I'm starving! *Her eyes sparkled as a huge grin forms on her face before transforming into a ginormous, pink jellyfish/octopus hybrid.*

_All of the guards' faces turned pale and immediately started to run away while Halley chased after them with a horrifying determination driven by hunger. Some of the guards attempted to kill her by shooting their rifles at her, but Iris quickly summoned a reflecting shield before any of the lasers hit Halley. Seeing that their efforts to kill the translucent monster was futile, they focused on getting away. The rest of the officers simply walked behind the rampaging monster that was trying desperately to capture one of the terrified guards with her venomous, gelatinous-like tentacles as she left behind destruction and a trail of a slimy substance that smelled like peaches..._

_In a dark office only illuminated by the holographic screens, the mastermind pondered what he was going to do next as he watched the pilots continue to trash his remaining ships with lasers when the assassin returned from outside with an emotionless expression._

Night Watcher: I apologize for not being able to hold them off long enough. One veteran cannot stop an entire army of veterans...

Astral Mastermind: It's fine. I have something else planned for the officers that are coming this way. *Stares at a holographic screen showing Halley continuing to chase the fleeing guards hungrily while the officers followed behind her.* I have one last task for you: Hold them off for as long as you can.

Night Watcher: I'll do my best. Farewell. *Bows one last time before pulling up her hood and walking out the door.*

_The assassin went into the dark, long hallway that leads to her boss's office. She changed something on the keypad that was located next to the door and walked away from the entrance far enough to give herself enough distance from the door._

Night Watcher: *Thinking.* I'll just need to place this trap here *Starts to install a small device on the wall.* to disable that shield protecting Halley and then go straight for her. Then, I need to take down the rest quickly...That Orca and Storm Chaser is going to be especially difficult to defeat. One hit from Clyde, I'll instantly die. If I don't outsmart Zebulon fast enough, I'll die. *Finishes installing the device and quickly hides behind a wall of another hallway connected to the one leading to the office.*

_The Night Watcher hid behind a wall and remained silent, listening for footsteps. A few minutes later, the assassin started to hear echoing footsteps and chatter that slowly became louder as they approached her. She summoned a bow and arrow and notched the arrow in place. She slowly drew the bowstring back and waited for her target to be in her sight. As she held the bowstring and arrow in place, the arrow slowly charged up with electricity while she continued to listen to the officers._

Halley: *Still in front of the other officers.* I only got to play with them...I stung a guy when I hit him with my tentacles by accident. *~*;;

Clyde: We're trying to complete the mission with minimal casualties, remember? At least you're not some variation of a box jellyfish...or a blue-ringed octopus. *Gives Halley two peaches, which she quickly consumes.* We had one unfortunate death, so far...Let's quickly end this.

Iris: Do you know any other individuals who could interfere with us, Zeb?

Zebulon: I heard he hired an assassin yesterday. However, I don't know who he or she is. Maybe we'll encounter the person today? Unless of course, we get killed by the individual first. *Shrugs.*

Iris: Are you saying that the person is possibly more skilled than a vigilant hitman yourself?

Zebulon: Who knows? Never underestimate your opponent- *Looks ahead and his eyes widen when he notices traps set up on the walls.* Halley! Don't go any further-!

Halley: What?! ;;;*^*)?!

_But, it was too late for the jellyfish monster. She tripped on the invisible lasers and triggered the trap, firing off a paralyzing shock to the unfortunate victim. It was enough to disable the shield and for her to convert back to her original form. Seeing the little jellyfish get shocked, Clyde summoned a rifle to disarm the traps, but he too was tased, this time with an arrow from his left, charged up with electricity. It was too much for him to handle and he fainted. With two of their most powerful members knocked out, the remaining officers eyed the corridor which the arrow came from. Zebulon and Alice took out their laser pistols and shot at the traps on the walls, disabling them. Before anyone could approach the unconscious officers, a shadow dashed across the hallway, grabbing a shiny object from Halley._

Iris: Hey…! That person took the oracle jewel! We need to catch that girl!

Zebulon: On it; come with me, Zayden. I need back up. *Runs after the thief.*

Zayden: Right! *Runs after Zebulon.*

Alice: The rest of us should try to quickly get into the office before they come back...I bet the boss has locked the door with a code.

Enzo: And that by itself can take some time… *Takes out his scroll.*

Iris: You two go ahead and attempt to get in. I'll stay by these two and try to wake them up.

Enzo: Right, let's get to it. *Both he and Alice run toward the door that leads into the boss's office.*

_Meanwhile, the two officers were chasing after the swift thief. They saw her make a sharp right turn into another hallway, but they both stopped in front of it._

Zebulon: Not a good idea to chase after her in there...She may have set up another trap with our names on it.

Zayden: You're right. But, she'll need to come back out from either of these hallways, as there is no other way to get out of here. Let's wait and hide until she appears again.

Zebulon: *Nods as he puts his back next to the left wall and motions Zayden to do the same to the right of him.*

_A few minutes later, Zebulon silently drew out his pistol. The sounds were inaudible to Zayden, but Zebulon's ears could pick up the sound of footsteps heading towards them and carefully concentrated on the faint noises that were increasingly getting louder. Seeing Zebulon ready himself, Zayden moved close to the edge of the hallway._

_The assassin was heading back towards the exit of the corridor. She knew that two enemies were most likely waiting to ambush her. However, she didn't have any choice, but to risk running through and hope that she could outspeed them._

Night Watcher: *Thinking.* It's all or nothing at this point. Knowing those two, I highly doubt I'll escape them, but I don't have any other options here-

_From the end of the hallway, her exit, she could hear the two officers quietly chatting. From what she could pick up, Zebulon told Zayden to head back to the rest of the group that he was capable of handling the rest. She heard someone walk away from the area..._

Night Watcher: *Prepares herself to sprint.* Now that there's only one person to deal with, I have a better chance.

_With what energy she had left, she sprinted forward. Zebulon immediately poked his head and pistol out from the left corner and started shooting at her. Confident that he wasn't going to hit her, she focused on running past him. However, the sharpshooter was missing on purpose and was aiming his shots in a way that caused the assassin to move to the right side._

Night Watcher: *Continuing to run and thinking to herself.* I'm almost there! I can't believe I'm actually going to get past this guy-

Zayden: *Jumps in front of the assassin.* And where do you think you're going?

Night Watcher: *Yelps in surprise and attempts to get away, but her right arm is immediately grabbed by Zayden.* Ugh...I thought one of you walked away…!

Zayden: Ha, tricked you. ;) Are you going to give up now?

Night Watcher: As much as it hurts for me to say it, yes. I don't have any other options; I surrender.

Zebulon: *Puts away his gun and walks toward them* Well now, that went rather smoothly. Zayden, you can let go of her. But if you run away, I won't hesitate to tase you, like what you did to our friends back there, got it?

Night Watcher: I won't, I won't… *Sighs heavily* I wonder if I'll be sacrificed next…

Zayden: *Lets go of her arm.* Shhhhhh...Don't give the boss any ideas! You're not going to die today.

Zebulon: We're not going to let another person be sacrificed in this mission. We might let you go after this, depending on how things turn out. So, who are you and when did he hire you?

Night Watcher: *Removes her hood.* It's me, Cyan~ He "hired" me _literally_ a day ago, when he kidnapped me while I was just cruising around the arena.

Zayden: Ah, thank goodness it's only you, Cyan…And you're fast, in space and on foot.

Zebulon: So, the boss forced you to work under him, just like we did temporarily when fighting the pilots earlier.

Cyan: Ehh? ;;*^*)?! You guys betr-

Zayden: *Covers Cyan's mouth.* We'll chat later, okay? You're on our side...Right?

Cyan: Of course. We should head back now...I hope I didn't hurt Clyde and Halley too much. \&gt;n\&lt;;;

Zebulon: *Starts walking back to where they came from.* I think they'll be just fine. They might even be back on their feet now since Iris was helping them when we left.

_The three of them returned to the long corridor and saw the remaining officers, including Clyde and Halley, standing around the door of the Mastermind's office. Even after so many attempts to get into the room by entering multiple passcodes, the barrier keeping them away from the final boss refused to open._

Enzo: Can't we just get Clyde to break open the door at this point? That would be much quicker than continuing to guess the passcode.

Clyde: If I must, then I will. *Summons a futuristic halberd that gives off an ominous aura.*

Cyan: *Approaches from behind* That won't be necessary, as I changed it earlier.

Iris: *Turns around* Hey there, Cyan. Not surprised that you were the quick thief. ;)

Cyan: I like to be fast, okay? xD Oh, and here's the jewel I picked off of you earlier, Halley. *Hands the item to her.*

Halley: Thank you~ You gave me quite a shock there. \&gt;m\&lt;

Clyde: It's certainly not the first time I've been shocked to the point that I get knocked out. *Stares at Enzo.* However, we're fine now, thanks to Iris.

Cyan: *Sighs in relief.* I'm glad you two are okay~ *Walks over to the keypad.* Before I type in the code, you guys have a plan, right?

Alice: Sure we do; we defeat the bad guy, arrest him, and finally end Operation Diamond.

Cyan: I was expecting a more elaborate and glamorous plan, but okie. What should I do?

Iris: I feel like I've asked you too many favors at this point, but can you be our communicator to the pilots? Stay out here and explain what has happened so far to them. If we need back up, we'll contact you. If he decides to run away, feel free to go after him. ;)

Cyan: Gotcha. I'm sure you all can easily take him down; you got this. \&gt;w\&lt;)b *Inputs the passcode into the keypad and the door unlocks*

Iris: Remember everyone, our goal is to capture and arrest the enemy. _Do not kill him_.
