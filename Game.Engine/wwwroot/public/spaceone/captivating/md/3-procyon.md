[Chapter Procyon]

> Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris) is the 8th brightest star in the night sky. This yellow-white colored star is also the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor. The star is part of an asterism known as the Winter Triangle. In the sky, it may seem like a single star, but it is actually a binary system. Procyon A is a main sequence star, a category of stars that are mainly fusing hydrogen in their cores. Procyon B is a white dwarf, the remaining, dense core of a star. The name Procyon means "before the dog", since it appears in the sky before the Dog Star, Sirius. You can pinpoint this star by finding Sirius and looking above it and to the left

_A few weeks have passed since the seven fragments first appeared in the arenas. The pilots have gotten used to them and started utilizing them regularly. However, what once used to be semi-rare are now appearing more often; the shards were also becoming brighter and more powerful. The ability power is now twice as powerful compared to what the shards used to provide. No evidence of why this is occurring has appeared yet until..._

Cyan: *Sips on her mocha and takes a bite of her roll cake in frustration(?).* Ugh, this shard mystery is like that Tabby Star mystery stuff back then! Just why...?! (\ *^*(\ *Gets up from her chair and walks up to a window, staring off into space, literally.*

"...unite all to destroy all...To bring _her_ here...You have until the 20th of the Winter Hexagon divided by two...complete Operation Diamond...Don't fail...don't let them know..."

Cyan: ?!? An intercepted transmission?! *Dashes to her ship's main computer and pulls up the intercepted message on a holographic screen.* Oooo-finally something interesting!~ *Starts to read it frantically.* Seems like it came from Sirius, one of the closest stars from the Sun. *Focuses her telescope on Sirius.* There must be somebody there, like a ship revolving around either Sirius A or Sirius B. Time to pull off an all-nighter! *^*)9

_The next day, Cyan hastily ran toward Mod's Lounge Room, where the mods were discussing the destructive shards._

dein Bruder: It's like as if these objects are becoming more and more game-breaking. Just the other day, someone managed to annihilate everyone in the entire arena with the Death Zone ability. Some pilots even started to avoid using them.

little dr.: I've noticed that while a bot holds a shard, they are now starting to crash for some unknown reason. The more shards a bot has, the quicker they break down. It might be because of the continuous increase in power the fragments provide.

Strange: You haven't encountered anything that could explain why these shards more becoming more powerful?

little dr.: From what I'm aware of, these fragments simply appear in the arena without any indicators of what is causing all of this. While Cyan was able to find out where they were coming from, she doesn't know what or who is responsible for the shards. Ever since we first saw them, they've increasingly become more abnormal...

Cyan: *Rushes into the room in a frenzy.* Sorry to interrupt but...Look at what I got last night! *^*)9

Strange: Got what?

Cyan: *Turns on a holographic tablet and set it on the table.* Read this. I was lucky enough to encounter this message.

*The three mods carefully read over the intercepted message.*

dein Bruder: Sounds like someone has a mission to bring a person here...By destroying all?

Strange: And who is this "her"?

Cyan: Unfortunately, I have no idea. Probably some important leader or something like that. But, I managed to figure out where this message originated from. It came from a massive fleet from Sirius.

little dr.: Makes sense, since you did say that the other stars that are producing shards were as bright as Sirius. Perhaps that's where the main operating base is located.

Cyan: Mhm~ I've got a feeling that whoever is over there...They're the one who is creating the shards.

Strange: Explain…

Cyan: The message said something about "Operation Diamond". We know that the shards are diamond-shaped and that they come from the seven stars….With Sirius being one of those seven. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that the supposed recipient of the message is responsible for creating those shards from the stars' energy. *Mumbles* _Even if it makes absolutely no sense scientifically but I'm just going along with it anyways for the story. \&gt;.\&gt;_

Strange: Nice discovery Cy!

Cyan: Like I said, I was lucky with encountering it. ^^;

little dr.: *Skims over the message.* How I interpret the message is that this individual or group are trying to bring someone into this part of space by killing off those who are already here. There is a time limit until Operation Diamond is over and possibly the targeted group aren't supposed to know?

dein Bruder: ?! Wait, what if we are their target? Could they be planning to wipe us out?

Cyan: Ehhhh?! QAQ;;;;

Strange: ...! That means they might have already started that process! Now that I think about it, those shards have been getting more common and powerful, allowing pilots to destroy multiple fleets at once. Plus, the abilities the fragments provide are becoming more game-breaking, as dB mentioned earlier. Also, the dr. said that his bots eventually crash whenever they hold the shards.

Cyan: Oh dear, this escalated so quickly!

dein Bruder: But, how much time do they have until they fail their mission? "Until the 20th of the Winter Hexagon divided by two"?

little dr.: There are six stars in the asterism. Six divided by two is three...Three what?

Strange: It sounds like it's a month...Until the 20th of three. Maybe March?

little dr.: So, they basically have until the 20th of March to destroy us. That's a pretty specific date.

Cyan: Oh-I know _exactly_ why. March 20th is the first day of spring, also known as the Spring Equinox. By then, you wouldn't be able to see the Winter Hexagon at night in the Northern Hemisphere. That probably has to do with whoever they're trying to summon here. That's why they can't fail...Because they'll have to wait until late fall to pull it off again. I bet producing these shards take a lot of effort as well...

Strange: Ah, makes sense. Looks like we got a war we can't avoid since it affects everyone.

Cyan: Gasp! That means all of the servers have to unite. :0

dein Bruder: It sure seems like it. But, we should gather some intel about who we are facing up against first.

little dr.: Agreed. Cyan, do you think you'll be able to intercept more transmissions coming from that fleet?

Cyan: I can try, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's possible they might already be aware that we know what they're up to. We need a backup plan to learn more about them.

dein Bruder: How about sending a few of our most agile pilots over there? I know that the star is far away, but maybe they can get there via Ansible.

little dr.: Leave that to me...This is going to be interesting, teleporting pilots near a star.

Cyan: As long as they don't get too close. ^^;

little dr.: I'll also contact the bot builders on the West server to see if they can send a bot to communicate to other pilots in the arenas who doesn't have Discord.

Strange: I'll send out an urgent message right away on Discord about this matter…

dein Bruder: A SASSC meeting is planned for today, so I'll bring this issue to the table.

Cyan: Of course, I'll continue to monitor all that space jazz and give you updates~

_The news quickly spread throughout the three arenas, like the energy of a gamma-ray burst traveling through space, which set off another energetic burst...of motivation from one certain pilot._

Arkham: How dare they-that's my job! To take over other servers and become the ultimate overlord!

Boss: *Reading a manual about defensive play.* I guess that you're back in business?

Reality: Maybe you'll actually be successful at conquering those guys.

Arkham: Pfft, of course! Maybe this is the moment when we can use that formation that I came up with while back.

Reality: _Maybe._ Good luck with that.

Boop: *Cough cough* Such a convenient time to watch someone build up their broken ego…

Arkham: *Ignores Boop's remark.* What, you're not going to help me, R?

Reality: Eh, I'll just sit back and watch for now.

Arkham: What-why?

Reality: Because we don't even know what they-

*The message notification sound went off on everyone's messenger.*

Boss: *Opens up Discord and reads the message.* Uhhh, guys? You all might want to look at it...

_The message reads the following:_

"Attention! Some unrecognized visitors have been spotted in all three arenas. They are not your typical bots you're used to. Approach them with extreme caution...If you dare" - α CMa
