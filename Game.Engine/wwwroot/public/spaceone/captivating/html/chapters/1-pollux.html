<p>[Chapter Pollux]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pollux (Beta Geminorum) is the brightest star in the constellation Gemini. It is named after one of twin brothers from Greek and Roman mythology. The other twin, Castor also has a star named after him, but is less brighter than Pollux. However, the two stars are not twin-like at all. Pollux is a orange-colored star that is the closest giant star to the Sun; it is located approximately 34 light years away from here. It is the 17th brightest star in the night sky. Pollux can also be located by drawing a northwestern line that goes through Rigel and Betelgeuse</p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Skimming over some code that is displayed on a holographic screen.</em> Hm...this is taking me longer than I thought. I would have liked to send this killbot out on a test run today, but I guess that can wai-</p>

<p>Madara: <em>Hastily opens the door and dashes up to little dr.'s desk.</em> GUESS WHAT I FOUND?!?</p>

<p>little dr.: Whoa, whoa, relax...! What could you possibly have for you to be <em>this</em> energetic?</p>

<p>Madara: <em>Takes out a few containers containing individual, different colored, glowing fragments.</em> I found some of these things in the arena!</p>

<p>little dr.: Hmm? <em>Picks up a container with a small, white shard and examines it closely</em></p>

<p>Madara: What are they?</p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Tilts the container to move the shard around.</em> Actually, I do-</p>

<p>GUCCI: <em>Rushes into dr.'s office.</em> Sorry to interrupt, but I just found a bunch of these weird shards floating in the arena. I saw someone shot at one and their fleet was suddenly able to shoot faster, despite their large fleet size. Care to explain?</p>

<p>little dr.: Well, as I was saying, I have no clue what they are.</p>

<p>GUCCI: Say what now?</p>

<p>little dr.: I've never seen them before...You also mentioned something about a pilot being able to fire lasers faster?</p>

<p>GUCCI: <em>Nods.</em> It's like as if these fragments give you power-ups or something.</p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Looks at Madara.</em> Have you seen any unusual effects caused by these fragments?</p>

<p>Madara: I saw Paki moving super fast and he kicked my butt a few times. :v</p>

<p>GUCCI: I don't want to even think about a faster Cyan…</p>

<p>little dr.: Okay, anything else you two observed? <em>Examines the container with an orange-colored shard.</em></p>

<p>Madara: <em>Shakes head.</em> No.</p>

<p>GUCCI: Hmm, not that I've seen.</p>

<p>Boop: <em>Standing in the doorway.</em> How about a fleet shooting a destructive, long-distance laser?</p>

<p>Madara: Wut?</p>

<p>GUCCI: Wait...How destructive?</p>

<p>Boop: <em>Walks towards the group.</em> I was just minding my own business when suddenly I saw this streak of light coming from my right and watched it take down a few fleets all at once…</p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Looks at the different colored fragments</em> Seems like that each of these fragments provides a fleet with a unique ability.</p>

<p>GUCCI: If it's really not you who released them, then who did?</p>

<p>little dr.: I doubt the other bot builders are responsible and there hasn't been an update log about this, I believe. <em>Quickly checks the Captain's Log.</em> Yeah, no update on the Captain's Log.</p>

<p>Boop: <em>Glances at the containers and shards.</em> I see 7 different colors here...therefore pilots can acquire 7 different abilities. Anyways, I'm going to head back out and figure out what these shards do. Guess I'll attempt to have fun while avoiding getting killed <em>too often</em>.</p>

<p>Madara: Haha, race all of you to the arena! <em>Dashes out of the office immediately.</em></p>

<p>GUCCI: <em>Sighs.</em> There he goes...Might as well join you, Boop. Plan to join us, dr.?</p>

<p>little dr.: I might as well experience it for myself. Let me quickly contact EU and NA West first and ask them if they are also seeing these new features. <em>Pulls up Discord.</em></p>

<p>Boop: Got it, see ya later then. <em>Boop and GUCCI leave the office</em></p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Quickly messages both servers, glances at the shards, and gets up to leave</em></p>

<p><em>In the EU Server, the pilots were also facing the same effects from the mysterious shards…</em></p>

<p>Werewolf: So this light yellow shard gives you a temporary shield…? <em>Holds up a small fragment.</em></p>

<p>1: Yeah, these new shards give us new powers.</p>

<p>Werewolf: What does this do? <em>Picks up a blue-white shard.</em></p>

<p>1: I'd be careful with that if I were-</p>

<p>Werewolf: <em>Fires a powerful, single laser that immediately takes down a noob fleet that was shooting at him.</em> Oh-wasn't expecting that!</p>

<p>1: Ye, that shard packs a punch. xD You lose some of your ships though whenever you use it.</p>

<p>Werewolf: I see...Is this a new update?</p>

<p>dein Bruder: <em>Flies over to 1 and Werewolf.</em> No, it's not; and it seems like the NA server also has these fragments floating around.</p>

<p>1: Hm?</p>

<p>dein Bruder: <em>Shows the message from little dr.</em></p>

<p>Werewolf: Who is responsible for them?</p>

<p>dein Bruder: <em>Shrugs.</em> Perhaps an unknown hacker? little dr. claims that it's not him. Besides, he's been building bots lately.</p>

<p>1: Might as well have fun with it while it lasts, you know?</p>

<p>Werewolf: I guess we should figure out what these shards do in the meanwhile?</p>

<p>dein Bruder: Sure, why not. Does anybody happen to know how many different fragments there are?</p>

<p>1: So far, there are 4 unique abilities we know of: increased flight speed, increased firing speed, provide a temporary shield, and that...deadly laser.</p>

<p>Werewolf: I've noticed that they're kind of rare at the moment. Perhaps there are more out there. :D</p>

<p>dein Bruder: I'm going to message little dr. back before I continue playing. <em>Leaves the two pilots behind.</em></p>

<p>Werewolf: <em>Messenger beeps and checks it.</em> Oh, seems like Sasha has found a shard that gives pilots the ability to create a "death zone" around the player...Interesting.</p>

<p>1: Like the Death Zone that surrounds the arena?</p>

<p>Werewolf: <em>Nods</em> However, she's very confused about where these shards came from. It's like as if they suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</p>

<p>1: We'll eventually find out sooner or later…</p>

<p><em>Back in little dr.'s office...</em></p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Plops into his chair at his desk and pulls up Discord.</em> Hm…? dB messaged me...Probably answering that message I sent earlier. <em>Reads the response.</em> I see. So, those fragments are also in the EU arena as well. I bet that they are also in the West arena.</p>

<p>ThePilot: <em>Casually walks into little dr.'s office and notices the pile of shiny fragments on his desk</em> Looks like you already know about them, huh?</p>

<p>little dr.: I assume that you're here to discuss that?</p>

<p>ThePilot: <em>Nods.</em> I got that message from you earlier but decided to drop by here while I'm visiting the East section.</p>

<p>little dr.: Say...You're not the one responsible for these power-ups, are you?</p>

<p>ThePilot: Me? Nah. I thought it was you at first until you sent that message. I like these power-ups, though.</p>

<p>little dr.: I'm still curious about who implemented them...It'd be interesting if I could equip my bots with those fragments.</p>

<p>Strange: <em>Enters the office.</em> Thinking about that so soon? ;) <em>Walks up to the desk.</em></p>

<p>little dr.: Hah! Why, of course!</p>

<p>Strange: I found that this particular fragment's ability is to give you any random ability. <em>Places a pale orange shard on dr.'s desk</em> It forces you to adapt to whatever power you get from it.</p>

<p>little dr.: Interesting. <em>Makes note of it on a notepad.</em></p>

<p>ThePilot: I remember that some pilots lost fewer ships whenever they would split. I bet that's another ability.</p>

<p>Strange: I've noticed that too, especially when a larger fleet would split.</p>

<p>little dr.: That would benefit pilots that are dash-heavy. I could easily improve my bots with these mysterious shards if I wanted to.</p>

<p>Strange: Heh, I guess that future of you taking over Spaceone is getting closer. ;)</p>

<p>little dr.: Before I do that, I'm going to look into them first. I'll try to figure out where they exactly come from and see if they'll permanently stay in the game.</p>

<p>ThePilot: Roger that. I might as well do some digging myself. I'll see you all later. <em>Waves as he walks out.</em></p>

<p>Strange: So, nobody claimed responsibility for them, huh?</p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Shakes head.</em> So far, nobody has reported anything suspicious relating to the fragments. I suppose that we might as well play along with it for now. Heh, this kind of reminds me when we suddenly saw those bots for the first time a few months ago…</p>
