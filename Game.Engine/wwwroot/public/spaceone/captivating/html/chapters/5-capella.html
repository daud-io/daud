<p>[Chapter Capella]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Capella (Alpha Aurigae) is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the charioteer, symbolizing as the charioteer's shoulder. It is the 6th brightest star in the sky and it appears as a yellow-white colored star. Capella in Latin means, "little goat", named after the goat that nursed Zeus when he was hidden away from his father, Cronus. Capella is a star system that consists of four stars in two binary pairs. It is also one of the closest sources of X-rays that comes from one of it's older stars. To find the Goat Star, locate the Big Dipper. Use the two stars that make up the top of the bowl and look to the right.</p>

<p><em>Along with the rebellious officers, the pilots immediately started to arrange a master plan that would put a halt to</em> <em>Operation Diamond</em><em>. The pilots were using Enzo's handy ECS scroll to communicate with the officers.</em></p>

<p>Arkham: Ooookay <strong>@everyone</strong> , it's time to completely annihilate those goons and kick them out of the Milky Way! <em>Completely ready to show dominance and no mercy towards the intruders.</em></p>

<p>Cyan: Now now, let's not get ahead of ourselves here~ <em>Sips her mocha.</em> -w-)</p>

<p>dein Bruder: Well, we did think up of an idea on how we can possibly combat our enemy earlier.</p>

<p>Enzo: Honestly, I think we can make it work in our favor, as long as we execute each phase with accuracy.</p>

<p>Zebulon: All the officers of Astral Passageways are here with Enzo and I. Well, except for one.</p>

<p>Munch Munch: Wait, so how many?</p>

<p>Enzo: Seven of us.</p>

<p>Reality: Why so many officers?</p>

<p>Enzo: Long explanation short, we watch over the productions of the shards of each star; therefore, one officer for each star that makes up the Heavenly G.</p>

<p>Reality: Either you guys are sneaky or your colleagues are super oblivious to not realize what you all are up to.</p>

<p>Zebulon: Hm...I'd say both. We've been investigating this organization for quite awhile now, enough time for them to build up trust in us and become high ranking officers.</p>

<p>Strange: Sounds fishier than a school of the dr.'s fish bots...</p>

<p>little dr.: Hah!</p>

<p>Enzo: It was much easier to obtain such a high rank than we initially thought. Not going to complain about it, though.</p>

<p>Cyan: Soooo~ Who are the other officers/rebels? :3</p>

<p>Zebulon: The other five members are Zayden, Alice, Halley, Clyde, and Iris. Iris is the leader of our team. Halley is the only one not here because she's scouting the area outside the Solar System for the majority of the time.</p>

<p>Iris: Nice to finally meet you all, pilots of Spaceone. I'm ready to finally take these guys down. Also, I apologize for the loss of your friend...She seemed like a nice person…</p>

<p>Cyan: I'm still not over that… ;~;</p>

<p>Alice: It hasn't been easy for us either. It all happened so suddenly...I'm sure she's in a better place now, <em>somewhere embedded in a realm of conflicting fantasies and realities.</em></p>

<p>Strange: This time, everyone needs to be on their guard. They're most likely planning something terrible over there to attempt to lure in more victims.</p>

<p>Zayden: You've got us on your side, so we can easily let you all know if the organization is up to no good. We also appreciate that you all are willing to work with us.</p>

<p>Reality: It's better than walking onto an enemy's territory blind, something we must avoid at this point.</p>

<p>Cyan: At least we got some insiders so we can learn all about them. \&gt;:3 Let the plan of backstabbing begin~</p>

<p>Clyde: From what I've heard from Enzo so far, the basic plan is to carry out attacks on the fleets individually and intercept their SOS signals. While it is something we can pull off, we have one major obstacle…</p>

<p>little dr.: And that obstacle is?</p>

<p>Clyde: The goddess that Astral Passageways has been working on for the past few months to summon her.</p>

<p>Arkham: <em>Raises eyebrows.</em> A...goddess?</p>

<p>Munch Munch: You're kidding.</p>

<p>Zayden: <em>Shakes head.</em> Nope. What do you expect from an organization that grants people's wishes and creates power fragments from a star's energy in the first place?</p>

<p>Cyan: Heh heh~ Who are you guys trying to bring here?</p>

<p>Alice: A Titaness named Asteria, goddess of astrology, falling stars, and nocturnal oracles.</p>

<p>Cyan: Oh ho ho~ A deity from Ancient Greek mythology~ Everything makes so much more sense now. <em>w</em> And ew, astrology…</p>

<p>Arkham: <em>Stares blankly at Cyan.</em> Um, elaborate?</p>

<p>Cyan: Okay, okay. Alice just listed the powers Asteria has control over. By the time we would launch any sort of attack, the summoning ritual would almost be done, right Alice? .o.</p>

<p>Alice: <em>Nods.</em> Correct. The ritual is currently more than 75% completed.</p>

<p>Cyan: Scary...Basically, we're already experiencing the effects of Asteria's powers. We've observed a steady increase of the shards, along with a noticeable amplification of the power the shards provide, in order to speed up the summoning process.</p>

<p>Zayden: So you've picked up on that too, huh?</p>

<p>Cyan: Yeah. Once this ritual is almost complete, whoever is going to receive those powers, s/he may be able to receive vague messages from other gods/goddess that pertains to the future. This means that the new Oracle will be able to have some idea what we're planning to do. How crafty! <em>m</em>)9</p>

<p>Reality: As if we already don't have enough to deal with...</p>

<p>Strange: Is Asteria known to be evil?</p>

<p>Zebulon: Well, from the various stories about Asteria, she's not necessarily evil or anything. In the myths, she turned her herself into a quail as she was being pursued by the playboy Zeus and threw herself into the ocean, becoming an island called Delos.</p>

<p>Iris: Okay, are you space elves done nerding out? :3</p>

<p>Zebulon: Says the Messenger of the Gods herself. <em>Gives his boss an annoyed look.</em> However, someone can become <em>influenced</em> by her powers and use them for selfish, destructive desires, should they dare to do so.</p>

<p>Zayden: Anyways, back to our battle plan. The latest we can attack the organization without feeling the negative effects of the summoning is probably sometime next week. However, the sooner we attack, the better.</p>

<p>little dr.: That'll give me enough time to be able to create a portal to each of the stars via ansible. I can also ask ThePilot to just send a bunch of EvilBots over there as a welcoming gift.</p>

<p>Strange: Oh-I know the perfect gift dr. can give them: The Daud army. I know that I had a fun time with +40 zombie fleets coming straight at me, heh.</p>

<p>Clyde: Zombie fleets?</p>

<p>little dr.: Bots that chase an unfortunate pilot while shooting lasers constantly until the player dies.</p>

<p>Clyde: I'm assuming they respawn once killed?</p>

<p>little dr.: <em>Nods.</em> An unending horde of bots…</p>

<p>Clyde: Interesting bot build, dr. I wonder if they can be modified so a virus could be attached along with their code so once opened, it would infect the entire ship system…Maybe that virus could also spread to the other ships within the fleet?</p>

<p>little dr.: Thanks. I've never thought about including a little bonus prize with the Dauds. However, from what the other bot builders and I've seen, the language you use is entirely foreign to us.</p>

<p>Clyde: No worries, leave it all to me. Just focus on connecting the other locations with each other and where you are based.</p>

<p>Enzo: Please do, Clyde. I know they'll hate that so much... <em>Smiles mischievously.</em></p>

<p>Clyde: As long as dr. is completely fine with me modifying his zombie bots.</p>

<p>little dr.: I don't mind, go for it. I'm curious to see how they'll turn out.</p>

<p>Clyde: Thanks! We can discuss it in detail later after this meeting concludes.</p>

<p>Strange: Seems like you're also a programmer, Clyde. Is there any difference between what you and Enzo do?</p>

<p>Clyde: At the organization, I work with Enzo, developing new stuff. What I really do is collect classified information and obtain a copy of their ship's operating systems before destroying it or at least making it inaccessible to the owner. Enzo doesn't hack and program viruses like I do.</p>

<p>Enzo: Other than that, there isn't too much of a difference of what we do. We create programs with different intentions but have the same goal of arresting or capturing criminals.</p>

<p>Strange: Oh, gotcha.</p>

<p>dein Bruder: So, you will mainly focus on attacking from the inside while we distract them from the outside?</p>

<p>Enzo: Mhm. Because we are dealing with 35 massive ships, we'll need some time to gain complete control of each vessel and deactivate them. Our plan is to simply overwhelm them until they subdue. All you need to do is attack them while being aware of what they'll do to protect their ship.</p>

<p>Munch Munch: Wouldn't we end up destroying a ship if we were to attack it enough?</p>

<p>Alice: These ships have that protective shield, which also activates when it is low on "health" automatically. By the time it activates, Clyde's virus would have taken over the systems. They wouldn't be able to do anything once that happens.</p>

<p>Clyde: I'll modify when the shield will activate. I'll probably allow it to activate when the ship is right at the edge of destruction. But, by all means, feel free to shoot it all you want until it activates.</p>

<p>Enzo: I'd make sure you give them *some wiggle room, Clyde…</p>

<p>*"Some mercy."</p>

<p>Clyde: Of course... ;)</p>

<p>Cyan: While you guys do that all of that jazz, I'll intercept the SOS signals they sent out. Maybe I'll even change the original message up a bit too before I send it. :3</p>

<p>Iris: Keep in mind that each ship sends out status reports regularly. The frequency used by each of the fleets are slightly different.</p>

<p>Cyan: Greaaaaat...Even if I'm off by a tiny bit, they'll notice the difference, knowing that you guys have some advanced tech. =3=</p>

<p>Iris: Most likely. But, the frequency shouldn't change that much if you were to change up the message. Besides blocking messages sent by the other fleets, you'll also have to handle the messages you receive from the main ship.</p>

<p>Cyan: Right, right. I'll let you all know about the real message I get from the big guys if I decide to change it.</p>

<p>Iris: Alright, as long as you don't say anything that will make them suspicious. I'll send you all of the fun stuff about our message relays later.</p>

<p>Cyan: Okie dokie~ (b 'o')b</p>

<p>dein Bruder: Sounds good to me. What else do we need to discuss about? Maybe a few backup plans in case something goes wrong?</p>

<p>Enzo: Always a good idea to have thought out Plan O0 though M9. ;)</p>

<p>Cyan: ...Hottest to coolest ~~stars~~ plans? ^^;</p>

<p>Zebulon: <em>Not amused in the slightest.</em> Enzo why…?</p>

<p><em>Another hour passed by of more planning, followed by a necessary debate of who should lead the charge of attacking the enemy fleets.</em> <em>(You probably all know it's going to be Lord D'Ark. Or Reality. Or both.)</em></p>

<p>Cyan: I feel like we've debated about who's going to be leader longer than what we've discussed before it. ^^;</p>

<p>Munch Munch: I agree, Cyan. <em>Looks over at Arkham and Reality.</em></p>

<p>Strange: It never gets old… ;)</p>

<p>dein Bruder: Well, after that "lively" little debate, should we wrap up our meeting?</p>

<p>Alice: ! One more thing: Collect as many of those shards as you can. Once you come over here, there won't be any more for you to collect during battle. I recommend to only collect one kind of "offensive" shard, like the ones from Sirius or Rigel and use them wisely.</p>

<p>Zayden: I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but if you activate a shard's ability when there are other fleets nearby with the same shard, it amplifies the ability even further without consuming the usual amount.</p>

<p>Munch Munch: Oooh, that's good to know. That way, we can reduce the number of shards used individually.</p>

<p>Alice: Also, once we completely take over a fleet, we would have access to that ship's supply of fragments.</p>

<p>Reality: If that's the case, then shouldn't we attack the ships located at Sirius first in order to able to fire off piercing lasers for the majority of the fight?</p>

<p>Alice: While it would make the battle easier, high-grade shards degrade more quickly than low-grade shards. A shard from Sirius is one of those high-grades. Therefore, they don't last as long than a shard produced from Pollux. When it degrades, it simply converts to a low-grade shard. That's why we should go for Pollux first.</p>

<p>Arkham: Ah, so that's what happened to my pile of Sirius fragments...I thought someone stole and exchange them for some weaker ones, heh heh.</p>

<p>Cyan: I know the Pollux fragments can randomly give you any ability. Is it possible to turn them into other shards? +w+)</p>

<p>Alice: Finally, I can answer that question with a yes! I recently created a device that can do exactly what you asked.</p>

<p>Enzo: Huh? I thought you weren't finished with it…</p>

<p>Alice: Well, I finished building it like a week ago. I've been testing it out secretly. Normally, I don't allow anyone to use or recreate my inventions without it being patented first. However, I will let you use it once I get it approved by the actual organization that I work for. Safety first, you know?</p>

<p>Munch Munch: Wow, are you sure? Even before you have it patented?</p>

<p>Alice: As long as you don't abuse my trust…</p>

<p>Zebulon: "Don't do anything unethical or else you'll be sent to Sagittarius A*"</p>

<p>Cyan: Ehhh?! The black hole at the center of the Milky Way?! ;;;owo) Alice, you scary…!</p>

<p>Iris: Um...I think we're all done here, right? ^^;</p>

<p>little dr.: I believe so. <em>Skims through his notes.</em></p>

<p>Reality: <em>Looks at the time.</em> A productive meeting that actually lasted for more than two hours…</p>

<p>dein Bruder: Now all we need to do is prepare everything vigilantly. Hopefully, they won't pick up on what we're trying to do.</p>

<p>Zayden: I know that the organization is aware that you will attack them soon. From what I've been hearing, they're underestimating what you guys are capable of and how much you know. That doesn't mean to slack off, though.</p>

<p>Strange: We'll do our best to be as prepared for any situation that arises. Are you all sure that you won't need any help attacking from the inside?</p>

<p>Iris: Oh, we'll be fine by ourselves, but thanks. We have our own way of bringing down enemies. ;)</p>

<p><em>The meeting concluded and the officers of</em> <em>Astral Passageways</em> <em>looked at each other.</em></p>

<p>Iris: Well, that went very smoothly. A productive meeting, indeed~</p>

<p>Zebulon: ...Do we still not know his true identity?</p>

<p>Clyde: Does it really matter? He's still a top wanted criminal. I'm just ready to watch the organization crash and burn after being with them for so long. I need a \&lt;br\&gt;...</p>

<p>Alice: <em>Shrugs.</em> Either way, someone will end up becoming an oracle...</p>

<p>Enzo: As long as he doesn't become one, then we're good.</p>

<p>Zayden: Wait, wouldn't someone else have to become one then...?</p>

<p><em>The door opens from behind them.</em></p>

<p>???: Hm? Trying to plan something without me…?</p>
