## Dueling FAQs-

### What is a duel?
A prearranged combat between two players, fought with fleets and lasers according to an accepted code of procedure, especially to settle a private quarrel… and in this case, to showcase your skills.  

### How can I set up a duel?
There are two types of duels- Challenge Duels and Impromptu Duels. Both types are considered official duels if there is a finalized score.  

To set up Challenge Duels, the easiest and simplest way is through Reddit and/or Discord, via public or private messages.

Impromptu Duels occur in-game. Duelers can ‘spin’ or ‘shake’ to indicate a duel, but it is suggested to use a crossed swords emoji to indicate dueling, not teaming. (See ‘’) Note: Impromptu duels are definitely possible, but there is no guarantee that both players have agreed on an accepted code of procedure. Still, I have had many a duel started in-game.  

### Why would I want to duel?
There is more to spaceone than high scores and arena records. Duels can be laid back, but tend to shift toward bursts of intense, high-stress 1v1 playing. For me, personally, I was able to get out of my comfort zone and embrace dashing as the weapon it is. Maybe you want to experiment with a smaller fleet and more dashing, or perhaps concentrate on higher accuracy and faster reflexes… whatever your reason, it allows you to focus your attention on one player in order to adapt in some way. It’s interesting for other reasons as well; for example, the stress is simply moving from keeping and retaining a high score of points… to crushing other players.  

## What is the basic set up of a duel?

### The Challenge
Strange: Hey Pakistani Bully, I challenge you to a duel.

### The Location
Pakistani Bully: Sure, when and where?
Strange: NE corner, 8pm est. NA East server.

### The Terms
Pakistani Bully: So what are we playing to? Six rounds? Strange: Sounds good. Usual dueling etiquette? Pakistani Bully: Yeah

### The Duel
Pakistani Bully and Strange hash it out in the NE corner for several rounds. Eventually, Strange reluctantly concedes defeat after a crushing battle of 0-6 in Pakistani Bully’s favor  

Both duelers should keep score, either via PMs or in-game names. For example, in this duel, I was S-P//0-6, and Pakistani Bully was ‘Stra vs Paki 0-6.’ Both duelers should update the score constantly, throughout continual deaths. If the death was questionable as to whether or not it was a deserved kill, add a question mark, asking for the other dueler to confirm score. On completion of the duel, both duelers should agree on ending score.
 

Note: there are different terms for indicating location. NW (top right corner), NE (top left corner), SW (bottom right corner), SW (bottom left corner).  

What happens if one dueler becomes #1 (leader)?
Both duelers have responsibilities should this situation occur. The dueler that becomes #1 (let’s call him Pakistani Bully) should either do one of the following:  
    a) Commit suicide and return to meeting place or
    b) Follow through with being leader, but return to original meeting place ASAP.
 

The other dueler, Strange, should NOT engage Pakistani Bully while Pakistani Bully is leader. Especially in a crowded server, interference is too high within the killzone that surrounds the leader. Personally, I’m leaning option a) and both players mutually returning to the dueling ground.
 

### What about interference?
It should be noted that kill-points should only be counted if the enemy’s lasers made the killshot. That saying, interference is definitely a grey area. Interference is bound to happen, so it’s best to be prepared. In my own experience, both duelers pause (possibly with a spin added to signal the pause), and defeat or ward away the interfering player. During this temporary pause, kill-points are not counted for either player. If the duelers are separated or one is killed, return to the dueling ground.  

### What about lag?
Lag is tricky. If one or both players are experiencing lag, the duel can be cancelled due to laggy weather. If both players are comfortable with the level of lag, the duel can be continued. Try to be vigilant and assertive when recognizing the signs of lag mid-duel, and act on integrity and honesty. Points should be updated and revised as necessary, as long as both players agree. The honor system really comes into play, here. Just remember duels can always be postponed until later.
 

### Are surprise attacks allowed?
Every round of dueling should begin with both players onscreen, and both ‘shaking’ or ‘spinning’ to signal that they are ready. After the initial spinning occurs, the dueling round begins, including ‘surprise attacks.’ Once a kill point has been made, the next round begins after another mutually agreed upon shaking/spinning occurs.
 

### What happens if the duelers are separated?
Return immediately to agreed-upon dueling ground. Try to have good communication with the other dueler, so even if one dueler has to leave expectantly, the other dueler will not be inconvenienced.
 

### How does one player win the duel?
There can either be an agreed-upon ending score, or dueling until one player is too tired to continue, or needs to leave.  

### Who keeps track of points?
Both duelers keep track of points, preferably via in-game. Although it is possible to have an external moderator, it is not necessary. There is also potential for two types of dueling- To the Death, or To the Pain. TtD is exactly how it sounds- kill-points are awarded upon the death of a player. TtP is more efficient in that it allows duelers to concede a round if one dueler is left with one ship. TtP is signaled by spinning or shaking, and should be pre-agreed upon by both duelers as to what type they will be using- TtD or TtP. Scores can be kept in-game by both players; once one dueler has died, s(he) can re-update the scores if necessary. For example, following a similar format to ‘S-P//0-6’ or ‘Stra vs. Paki 0-6’
 

### What about nonparticipant players?
Some nonparticipant players in the server may be able to avoid interfering with the duel if the crossed swords flag is being used by both duelers, indicating that a duel is in process and other players should respectfully choose not to engage if they have prior knowledge of dueling.
 

### Some other suggestions…
Many players have brought up that a player’s skillsets aren’t determined solely on the Space1 World Records page… I agree with them.
 

Dueling is also a great way to showcase skills. I would like to propose a page, similar to the Space1 World Records, one that contains logs of various duels. A Wall of Shame and Honor… and, I would like to add, for me right now, it contains more shame than honor ;-)  

I think one of the best ways to regulate this would be for one player to submit the date and official names of the players, and both participating duelers would verify the log. A mixture of accountability and honor system, if you will. From this, it would also be possible to put a bunch of this data into an excel and spit out the current player with the highest kill/death ratio. This is a list that, if properly updated, would constantly change. This might also help stimulate the subreddit, and/or discord.
 

So if a mod approves of this idea, could a page similar to the Spaceone World Records be created? This would make it easier for players to submit/verify the dueling logs.
 

Disclaimer: Although that was the ending score of last night between Pakistani Bully and me, that conversational was fictional. Our duels are usually more impromptu.
